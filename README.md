## 1.1 Business Understanding
With the current generation embracing technology and its applications, many people have become accustomed to the idea of using dating apps. Therefore, Pata Mchumba,  a dating company, has approached us to create a recommendation system for their users to increase the effectiveness of matches based on their preferences. Moreover our recommender will focus mainly on emotional connection rather than physical appearance. 
## 1.2 Objectives
### Main Objective:
To build a dating app recommender system that successfully maximises the matches.
### Specific Objectives
## 1.3 Data Understanding
Our data was sourced from https://github.com/rudeboybert/JSE_OkCupid/blob/master/profiles_revised.csv.zip. We considered the ethical concerns and no rights were infringed in the collection of this data as OKCupid provided this data for use by the public.
The data contained 31 columns and 59964 columns.
## 1.4 Metrics for success
Our metric of success is Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). We aim for a value that lies between 0.2 and 0.5 with a preference of the lowest value in this range for better accuracy of the model.
